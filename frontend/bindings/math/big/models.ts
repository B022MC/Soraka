/**
 * An Int represents a signed multi-precision integer.
 * The zero value for an Int represents the value 0.
 * 
 * Operations always take pointer arguments (*Int) rather
 * than Int values, and each unique Int value requires
 * its own unique *Int pointer. To "copy" an Int value,
 * an existing (or newly allocated) Int must be set to
 * a new value using the [Int.Set] method; shallow copies
 * of Ints are not supported and may lead to errors.
 * 
 * Note that methods may leak the Int's value through timing side-channels.
 * Because of this and because of the scope and complexity of the
 * implementation, Int is not well-suited to implement cryptographic operations.
 * The standard library avoids exposing non-trivial Int methods to
 * attacker-controlled inputs and the determination of whether a bug in math/big
 * is considered a security vulnerability might depend on the impact on the
 * standard library.
